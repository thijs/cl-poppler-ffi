Common Lisp CFFI for the poppler library
===========

See docs in `doc/` or online [here](http://thijso.com/cl-poppler-ffi/doc/index.html).


### UNFINISHED & UNTESTED

At this point this is basically only a helper library for one of
my personal projects I'm working on. Only the functionality I
need at the moment is exposed.

It is mostly unfinished (the only done parts are descibed in the
documentation found in `doc/`), and most definitely **untested**. So
use at your own risk.


### QUICKSTART

On a recent Ubuntu machine I got it working like this:

- get libpoppler-qt4-dev installed through aptitude (including its deps)
- get the usual dev tools installed (compiler, etc)
- go to the install dir cl-poppler-ffi and do:

gcc -fpic -c poppler-qt4_customwrap.cxx -I/usr/include/qt4 -I/usr/include/poppler/qt4 -I/usr/include/poppler
c++ -shared /usr/lib/libpoppler-qt4.so /usr/lib/libQtGui.so /usr/lib/libQtCore.so poppler-qt4_customwrap.o -L/usr/lib/ -o libpoppler-qt4-ffi.so

Maybe you need to adapt the paths to fit your own setup.

If everything went well, you should have a libpoppler-qt4-ffi.so file
ready for use.
